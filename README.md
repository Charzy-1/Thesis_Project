## Close Price Prediction of NASDAQ using LSTM
## Description:
This project focuses on utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for predicting the close prices of stocks in the NASDAQ stock market. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can assist traders, investors, and financial institutions in making informed decisions.

## Key Features:

Implementation of LSTM models for close price prediction
Utilization of historical price data to train the models
Evaluation of model accuracy and performance
Exploration of advanced LSTM architectures and techniques
Incorporation of external factors for improved predictions
Comparative analysis with other prediction models
Consideration of challenges and limitations in the prediction process

## Future Work:
Further improvements in model accuracy and predictive capability
Integration of ensemble approaches for enhanced performance
Exploration of additional external factors to capture market dynamics
Comparative analysis with other deep learning models
Consideration of real-time market changes and adaptation of models
Investigation of interpretability and explainability of LSTM predictions
